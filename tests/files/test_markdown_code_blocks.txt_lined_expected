A code block:

```
Things in here
shouldn't
    be reformatted

Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit. Vestibulum id ligula porta felis euismod semper.

Nor should be things like this be treated like bullets:

* Maecenas sed diam eget risus varius blandit sit amet non magna. Nulla vitae elit libero, a pharetra augue.
```

This is also a code block

```python
def is_non_block(line):
    patterns = [
        r'^[A-Za-z]+, \d{1,2} [A-Za-z]+ \d{4}$',  # date
        r'^(~<|>~)',                              # excerpts
        r'^\s*\|( |$)',                           # line quote
        r'^(\s*:|\.\. )',                         # rst items
        r'^[-#=~]{3,}',                           # separator/heading
    ]

    for pattern in patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, line):
            return True

    return False
```

This doesn't start a code block ``` but could mess things up on a
reformatted line if it ended up at the start of a line.

```` This is not a code block starter


It's better to have blank lines before fenced code blocks but let's
still handle if not
```
blah
    blah
        blah
```
And we continue to do stuff
